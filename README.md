## What it is

Three Good Things is a **local-only reflection app** designed for daily use on your phone or tablet.

- Short, focused reflections
- Clean, distraction-free design
- Works instantly in the browser
- No sign-ups, no logins

---

## Privacy-first by design

Your reflections are **saved only on your device**.

- No accounts
- No analytics
- No servers storing your data
- Nothing is uploaded or synced

If you clear your browser data or switch devices, entries are removed.  
This is stated clearly in the app so users know exactly how it works.

✅ iPhone (all modern sizes: SE → Pro Max)
